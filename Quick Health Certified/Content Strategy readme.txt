I have developed a strategy for Quick Certified bootcamps that perfectly aligns with the needs of beginner-level target audiences. My content strategy focuses on beginners because bootcamps are primarily taken by individuals who want to understand what they entail, their scope, and the responsibilities involved.

If I conduct keyword research for highly technical topics, it would go beyond my target audience's understanding. For example, if we are selling a course on 'Pharmacy Technician,' I have created a content funnel for it. The first blog covers 'What is a Pharmacy Technician?' followed by blogs on responsibilities and salary, all internally linked. This approach ensures proper keyword clustering and an optimized internal linking structure.

The same strategy will be implemented across all category-specific blogs to maintain consistency and effectiveness.
